# Tip-Calculator

## The Challenge

It's always tricky to know how much to tip, unless you're an arithmetic mastermind!



Your task is to create a simple command-line (Node, Python or other) or front-end JavaScript application that will help calculate a tip at a restaurant for your server. No boilerplate code
will be provided, so you are free to construct this however you would like. However, your application must:



* Take in the value of the bill


* Take in the desired tip percentage


* Include the option to split the tip amount by number of people at the table

 

* The application should then calculate the amount of tip per table (or per person if the split option is chosen) and return that value to the user.

 

BONUS:

* Create a simple UI so that this can be used in a browser


* Deploy to your favorite hosting service (Heroku, Netlify, etc.)

 

## The Process 

Career Services will evaluate the submissions and come to a consensus on a winner. You will be evaluated upon completion of the requirements of the challenge, code cleanliness, and formatting. Career Services will evaluate the entries and pick a winning submission and will announce on July 12, 2019. 

### Restraints and Guidelines...

Please read these thoroughly. We will validate your submission based on the following criteria:

* Your code should be clean and readable. Don't neglect the comments!


* You must push your code in a git repository and submit git repository URL to the challenge email.


* Commit early, commit often; we will look at the progression of your code throughout application development. Consider your commits valuable. 


* You shouldn't need any external libraries to complete this application... BUT if you do, you need to document it in your readme and let us know why it was a better choice.

 

### Some additional requirements for your application:

* The bill value must be a positive float but your application must handle user input that might be a negative or 0 dollar amount (i.e. error handling).


* The user input percentage for the tip must be a positive float.


* The returned value must be a float rounded to two decimal points (i.e. accurate dollars and cents).
